; - Do not translate lines starting with ';', translate only numbered lines.
; - Keep texts short, otherwise they won't fit into their space. Above each text is a meter how long text may be, you should fit into it.
; - Keep quotes at beginning and end of text.
; - You may use one ampersand (&) in each line, which is used for keyboard shortcut when navigating among controls.

;---------------------------- Help texts ----------------------------

~help_no
<no help>

~help_disp
Display device, which will be used for displaying graphics.

~help_3d_dev
3D device used for rendering. By default, HAL device provides best performance.
Optional REF device may be selected for testing game functionality.

~help_res
Resolution of graphics window.
For fullscreen mode, this is the resolution, to which graphics will be set.
For non-fullscreen mode, this is the size of created window.

~help_depth
Bit depth of graphics window.
You may select the bit depth only for fullscreen mode. In windowed mode, the bit depth equals to bit depth of desktop window.

~help_ok
Save selected settings and close the dialog window.

~help_cancel
Discard settings and close the dialog window.

~help_apply
Apply current settings - store values into configuration file.

~help_settings
Additional settings applied to graphics window and rendering.

~help_fullscreen
Initialize graphics in fullscreen mode.
If this box is checked, the screen will be initialized to fullscreen, in selected display resolution.
When unchecked, the graphics will be presented in a window with selected size.

~help_tripple
Use triple buffering (applicable only in fullscreen mode).
When this is selected, the system allocates one extra buffer for faster swapping of rendered screen.
This may result in improved performance, but it also consumes more graphics memory.
This setting is suggested if your card have enough display memory (32 MB and more).

~help_compress
Use compressed textures.
By checking this box, you select to use compressed textures (if available by graphics card).
This may enable enhanced performance for the cost of slightly worse texture quality.

~help_filtering
Texture filtering mode.

~help_filter_linear
Linear texture filtering.

~help_filter_aniso
Anisotropic texture filtering.
If available by hardware, this setting will give textures a smoother look.

~help_anitialias
Antialiasing mode. The mode you select has usually a great impact on rendering speed.
The smoother antialias mode you select, the slower performance you may gain.
On the other side, antialiasing (if supported by graphics hardware) improves the quality of rendered images.

~help_snd_dev
Sound device, which will be used for sound playback.

~help_sounds
Enable sounds.
You may choose to disable sound playback if you have no sound card installed, or have problem with sounds.

~help_use_eax
Enable use EAX.
Note that this settings takes effect only if you have EAX-equipped sound card, such as SoundBlaster Live or similar.
If you encounter problems with the sound playback, you may want to disable this option.

~help_snd_hw
Play sounds through hardware sound buffers.
If you encounter problems with the sound playback, you may want to disable this option.

~help_database
Use caching into database located on a hard disk. This improves loading times significantly, by storing the pre-computed data (geometry, textures) onto huge hard disk file, so that the computed results are available when they're loaded next time.

~help_ref
Use reference device for rendering.

~help_no_vshader
Disable use of vertex shaders, if available by hardware.
If vertex shaders are unavailable, this option has no effect.

~help_no_pshader
Disable use of pixel shaders, if available by hardware.
If pixel shaders are unavailable, this option has no effect.
